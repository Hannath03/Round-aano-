### Project Description
 This project evaluates how perfectly circular a chapati is by measuring its area and perimeter and calculating its circularity‚Äîa shape factor that quantifies roundness. The circularity value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect circle.
### Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
Ever wondered if your beloved chapati could be reigning ‚ÄúMiss Circle‚Äù of the kitchen? This quirky program lets you upload an image of your chapati, then judges how perfectly circular it is by measuring its area and perimeter‚Äîand delivering the ultimate roast (pun intended)‚Äîall with a hilarious verdict!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
1. Spotlight Snap: Chapati, Strike a Pose!
You upload a top-down image of your chapati‚Äîthink paparazzi-style‚Äîbut softer lighting works just fine. The goal? Capture a clear, bird‚Äôs-eye view so your code doesn‚Äôt mistake a fold or glare for a crusty flaw.

2. Image Magic: Chapati on the Runway
The code converts the image to grayscale and applies thresholding to isolate the chapati from the background. Essentially, your chapati‚Äôs walking the catwalk, and this step draws the spotlight (a clean silhouette) around it.

3. Metrics Time: Size Up That Dough
The script hunts for the largest contour (that‚Äôs your chapati), calculates:
Area in ‚Äúpx¬≤‚Äù (pixel-squared fame), and
Perimeter in ‚Äúpx‚Äù (not paparazzi‚Äîjust edge pixels).
These are your chapati‚Äôs modeling stats.

4. Roundness Drama: The Ultimate Judge
The magic formula:
          Roundness=(Area*4*pi)/(Perimeter)^2
This is the gold standard in image shape analysis‚Äîwidely used in particle shape detection and beyond. A perfect circle scores 1; even a neat square only scores ~0.785, triangle ~0.605‚Ä¶ so chapati, take that, other shapes! 

5. Snapback Verdict: Comedy Meets Geometry
A tonal spin on the results:

> 0.95 ‚Üí ‚ÄúüèÜ Masterchef-level chapati!‚Äù (Yeah, you nailed that circle.)

0.85‚Äì0.95 ‚Üí ‚Äúüòã Pretty good! Grandma would be proud.‚Äù (Clap on your flour-covered shoulder.)

Else ‚Üí ‚ÄúüòÇ Good luck next time... needs work!‚Äù (Maybe roll a bit more evenly next time.)
